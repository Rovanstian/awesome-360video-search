Over the past years, Virtual Reality (VR) products, such as Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs), become widely available. 
With the growing popularity of commercial VR products, more viewers are able to watch 360-degree videos with HMDs.
Majority of present global Internet traffic is due to video data ([Global Internet Phenomena](https://www.sandvine.com/trends/global-internet-phenomena/)). 
Streaming 360{\degree} videos further increases the Internet traffic amount, and becomes a hot research topic.
Hence, I collected some awesome researches and resources here!
