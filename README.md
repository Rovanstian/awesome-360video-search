  A curated list of awesome 360-degree video papers and related resources. Inspired by [awesome-architecture-search](https://github.com/markdtw/awesome-architecture-search), [awesome-deep-vision](https://github.com/kjw0612/awesome-deep-vision), [awesome-adversarial-machine-learning](https://github.com/yenchenlin/awesome-adversarial-machine-learning) and [awesome-deep-learning-papers](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers).

Over the past years, Virtual Reality (VR) products, such as Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs), become widely available. 
With the growing popularity of commercial VR products, more viewers are able to watch 360-degree videos with HMDs.
Majority of present global Internet traffic is due to video data ([Global Internet Phenomena](https://www.sandvine.com/trends/global-internet-phenomena/)). 
Streaming 360{\degree} videos further increases the Internet traffic amount, and becomes a hot research topic.
Hence, I collected some awesome papers and resources here!
